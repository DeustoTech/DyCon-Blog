title: Exploration in the Chebfun Toolbox
description: Chebfun is a toolbox for MATLAB quite mature, a priori it offers an 
                improvement of precision in the calculations, however in this tutorial 
                we will focus on demonstrating how effective is the Chebfun library 
                within the context of the research the control problems. In a nutshell,
                let's see how useful this library is for the DyCon project.

(Chebfun example ode-nonlin/FourierCollocationNonLin) [Tags: #nonlinearODE, #periodic]

```matlab
LW = 'linewidth'; dom = [0 2*pi];
```


Chebfun uses Fourier collocation to solve linear, nonlinear and systems of ODEs with periodic boundary conditions. Consider the nonlinear ODE


$$ u' - u\cos(u) = \cos(4x), $$


on $[0, 2\pi]$, with periodic boundary conditions. For nonlinear ODEs, we need to specify an intial guess; let us try $\cos(x)$. We can solve the ODE in Chebfun as follows.

```matlab
f = chebfun(@(x) cos(4*x), dom);
N = chebop(@(u) diff(u) - u.*cos(u), dom);
N.bc = 'periodic';
N.init = chebfun(@(x) cos(x), dom);
u = N \ f
```


```

u =

   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values trig
[       0,     6.3]       73    -0.058   -0.058 
vertical scale = 0.24 


```


Let us plot the initial guess in dashed blue, and the solution in blue.

```matlab
figure, plot(N.init, '--b', LW, 2)
hold on, plot(u, 'b', LW, 2)
```

The solution $u(x)$ satisfies the ODE to high accuracy:

```matlab
norm(N*u - f, inf)
```


```

ans =

   3.6338e-13


```


If we start with another initial guess, we might obtain another solution. Let us try $\sin(x)^2$, plot it in dashed green, and plot the solution in green.

```matlab
N.init = chebfun(@(x) sin(x).^2, dom);
v = N \ f
hold on, plot(N.init, '--g', LW, 2)
hold on, plot(v, 'g', LW, 2)
```


```

v =

   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values trig
[       0,     6.3]       81       1.6      1.6 
vertical scale = 1.8 


```

The solution $v(x)$ satisfies the ODE to high accuracy too:

```matlab
norm(N*v - f, inf)
```


```

ans =

   2.8800e-12


```


For nonlinear ODEs, the relationships between intial guesses and solutions are difficult to analyse. In this example, we chose two different guesses, and this led to two different solutions.
