subdes: "Many models in population dynamics take care about spatial heterogeneity, this can lead for example to new types obstructions. In the blog, we explain the main features and the influence of an heterogeneous drift in a bistable equation called gene-flow. The heterogeneity in the drift comes from an approximation of a system of a system of two equations with an heterogeneous environment."

### Equation and drift effect

The equation under concern is:

$$ \begin{cases}
u_t-u_{xx}-2\frac{N_x}{N}u_x-=u(1-u)(u-\theta)\quad (x,t)\in (0,L)\times(0,T),\\
u(0,t)=a_1(t),\quad u(L,t)=a_2(t)\\
 0\leq u(x,0)\leq 1.
\end{cases}$$


where $N$ is a positive regular function.

 The physical meaning of the equation is a reaction-diffusion process on the proportion $u$ of individuals along a static heterogeneous distribution $N$.

The effect of this heterogeneous drift can be qualitatively understood in Figure 1. The blue line in the figure is the distribution $N$ and the orange one the term $-2\frac{N_x}{N}$. In the picture in the left we have the Gaussian with variance $\sigma$, leading to a drift effect that is pushing $u$ towards the boundary. At the right, we have the function $e^{x^2/\sigma}$ leading to the contrary effect, the population in the boundary is pushed inside the domain.

From the discussion above we expect the boundary control to be enhanced in the case of $N(x)=e^{x^2/\sigma}$ while diminished in the case of $N(x)=e^{-x^2/\sigma}$.

### Slowly varying drifts: Perturbed Stair-case method

Whenever the drift term $-2\frac{N_x}{N}$ is small enough, one can consider the already developed path in the homogeneous setting (see Blog <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tutorial/wp03/P0005">staircaise</a>), taka a sequence and apply the implicit function theorem to obtain a sequence close enough to guarantee the controllability (see [1] for details). This guarantees the controllability from the steady state $0$ to the target $\theta$. 

In Figure 2 an intuitive sketch of this procedure is represented.

### Large drifts: New Barriers

One of the main concerns when state-constraints are present is whether or not barriers exist (see Blog <a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tutorial/wp03/P0006">Barriers</a>). If $\theta<\frac{1}{2}$ then, for large $L>L_{\sigma}(0)>0$ we will have obstructions to reach $\theta$ and $0$ from $1$.

In the homogeneous case, nontrivial elliptic solutions with boundary value $1$ do not exist. However, in the case of heterogeneous drift this is no longer true in general.

If we set $N(x)=e^{-x^2/\sigma}$ then for every $\sigma$ one can find an $L_{\sigma}(1)>0$ big enough such that for every $L>L_{\sigma}$ there is a nontrivial solution with boundary value $1$. This nontrivial solution does not correspond to a global minima of the associated energy functional since the trivial solution $u=1$ is the global minimizer.

In order to understand how this barrier can exist we have to study the following non-autonomous dynamics in the phase-plane:

$$
\begin{cases}
\frac{d}{dx}\begin{pmatrix}u\\ v \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ -u(1-u)(u-\theta) \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}0\\ \frac{4}{\sigma}xv \end{pmatrix}\\
\begin{pmatrix}u(0)\\ v(0) \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{cases}
$$

Any solution of the ODE above is an elliptic solution for some boundary condition. What we want to find is that there exist an $L_{\sigma}(1)$ such that the solution of the ODE at $L_{\sigma}(1)$ is $1$.

Making use of the energy of the ODE 

$$ 
E=\frac{1}{2} v^2+\int u s(1-s)(s-\theta)ds 
$$ 

and seting $a$ small one can see that the trajectory of the dynamics will eventually cross $1$. See Figure 3.

In Figure 4 one can see the effect of the nontrivial solution in a simulation. The red lines are snapshots of the controlled trajectory, getting darker when advancing the time, the dotted blue line is the profile $N(x)$.

### Minimal controllability time depending on the drift

We have seen that the influence of the drift is key. Figure 5 shows the minimal controllability time for a fixed $L$ depending on the parameter $\frac{1}{\sigma}$. The initial state is the $0$ configuration and the target the constant steady state $\theta$.

When the variance is very big we tend to the homogeneous case, while when the variance decreases the opposite phenomena is observed; when the drift enhances the control the minimal controllability time is reduced making it tend to zero while, when the drift is pushing the population outside the minimal controllability time increases and eventually blows up with the emergence of the barrier.
