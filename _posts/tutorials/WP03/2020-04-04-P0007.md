title: Control of reaction-diffusion under state constraints
author: [DomenecR]
date: 2020-03-30
description:  Usually, the unknowns in  reaction-diffusion models are positive by nature. Therefore, for application purposes, any control strategy proposed should preserve this positivity. This group of tutorials is devoted to the understanding of phenomena and techniques arising in reaction-diffusion control problems when  state constraints are present.

Reaction-diffusion equations appear frequently in natural phenomena such as:
- Population dynamics and invasion of species (see [1]).
- Neuroscience, where models for neuronal impulses exhibit traveling waves (see [2]).
- Chemical Reactions: modeling the evolution of concentrations of chemicals (see [3]).
- In evolutionary game theory  (see [4, 5]).
- Magnetic systems in material science and their phase transitions (see [6]).
- Linguistics, we refer to [7] where the authors consider reaction-diffusion for analyzing language shift by means of a traveling wave.


In the majority of the systems mentioned above, the state $u$ of an equation of the type 

$$u_t-\Delta u=f(u)$$

represents a population, concentration or proportion. For this reason, any model intending to predict the behavior of such quantity must fulfill a maximum principle [8].

In this group of tutorials, our aim is to explain the phenomenology arising when considering a control problem in the contexts mentioned above.

In general, the controllability of parabolic equations has been widely studied (for instance [9,10,11]). However, in this literature, the requirement that the trajectory has to be positive or between prescribed bounds was not a concern.

In Figure 1 one can see a boundary control of the semilinear equation

$$\begin{cases}
u_t-u_{xx}=u(1-u)(u-0.33)\\
u(-L,t)=u(L,t)=a(t)\\
u(t=0,x)=0
\end{cases} $$


with $a$ being the control and the target function $v\equiv 0.33$.

<center>Control from $u(0)\equiv 0$ to $u(T)\equiv 0.33$.</center>

This model models the evolution of a proportion, and we observe that the control does not preserve the positivity of the state neither the meaningful upper bound.

From the application point of view of several of the applications mentioned, any control action proposed must fulfill that the associated trajectory has meaning.


The ideas exposed in this tutorial group are the following:
