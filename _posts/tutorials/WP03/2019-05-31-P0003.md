description: We analyze the controllability properties under positivity constraints on the control or the state of a one-dimensional heat equation involving the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$ ($0 < s < 1 $) on the interval $(-1,1)$. We prove the existence of a minimal (strictly positive) time $T_{\rm min}$ such that the fractional heat dynamics can be controlled from any initial datum in $L^2(-1,1)$ to a positive trajectory through the action of a positive control, when $s>1/2$. Moreover, we show that in this minimal time constrained controllability is achieved by means of a control that belongs to a certain space of Radon measures. We also give some numerical simulations that confirm our theoretical results.

In [2], we analyzed the controllablity properties under non-negative control and state constraints of the following heat-like equation involving the fractional Laplacian on $(-1,1)$

$$
\begin{equation}\label{frac_heat}
    \begin{cases}
        z_t+(-d_x^2)^s z = u\chi_{\omega}, & (x,t)\in (-1,1)\times(0,T)
        \\
        z = 0, & (x,t)\in (-1,1)^c\times(0,T)
        \\
        z(\cdot,0)=z_0, & x\in (-1,1).
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

In \ref{frac_heat}, $\omega\subset (-1,1)$ is the control region in which the distributed control $u$ acts. Moreover, we denote by $(-d_x^2)^s$ the fractional Laplace operator defined, for all $s\in(0,1)$, as the following singular integral

$$
(-d_x^2)^s z(x) := c_s \,P.V.\,\int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{z(x)-z(y)}{|x-y|^{1+2s}}\,dy,
$$

with $c_s$ an explicit normalization constant given by

$$
c_s = \frac{s2^{2s}\Gamma\left(\frac{1+2s}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(1-s)},
$$

Gamma being the usual Euler Gamma function.

The main result we established are the following results:

1. For any $s>1/2$, there exists $T>0$ such that the fractional heat equation \ref{frac_heat} is controllable to positive trajectories by means of a non-negative control $u\in L^\infty(\omega\times(0,T))$. Moreover, if the initial datum $z_0\geq 0$ is non-negative, we also have $z(x,t)\geq 0$ for every $(x,t)\in (-1,1)\times (0,T)$.

2. If we define the minimal controllability time by

$$
\begin{align}
    T_{min}(z_0,\widehat{z}):= \inf\Big\{T>0:\exists\;\; 0\leq u\in L^\infty(\omega\times(0,T)) \\ \hspace{5cm} such\;that\; z(\cdot,0)=z_0\; and\; z(\cdot,T)=\widehat{z}(\cdot,T)\Big\},
\end{align}
$$

we have $T_{min}>0$.

3. For $T = T_{min}$, there exists a non-negative control $u\in \mathcal M(\omega\times(0,T_{min}))$, the space of Radon measures
on $\omega\times(0,T_{min})$, such that the corresponding solution $z$ of \ref{frac_heat} satisfies $z(x,T) = \widehat{z}(x,T)$ a.e.
in $(-1,1)$.

These results extend to the fractional case the ones previously obtained by our team in the context of the linear and semi-linear heat equation (see our previous entries in the **DyCon Blog**, [WP3_P0001](https://deustotech.github.io/DyCon-Blog//tutorial/wp03/P0001) and [WP3_P0002](https://deustotech.github.io/DyCon-Blog//tutorial/wp03/P0002)).

In this post, we present some numerical development in order to find the minimal controllability time for the discretized
fractional heat equation with non-negative control constraint and to confirm our theoretical results.

In particular, we will consider the problem of steering the initial datum

$$
z_0(x) = \frac 12\cos\left(\frac \pi2 x\right)
$$

to the target trajectroy $\widehat{z}$ solution of \ref{frac_heat} with initial datum

$$
\widehat{z}_0(x) = 6\cos\left(\frac \pi2 x\right)
$$

and right-hand side $\widehat{u}\equiv 1$.

We choose $s=0.8$ and $\omega=(-0.3,0.8)\subset (-1,1)$ as the control region. The approximation of the minimal controllability time is obtained by solving the following constrained minimization problem.

$$
minimize\;T
$$

subject to

$$
\begin{cases}
T>0
\\
z_t+(-d_x^2)^s z=u\chi_\omega, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)\times(0,T)
\\
z(\cdot,0)=z_0\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)
\\
z\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)\times(0,T)
\\
u\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; \omega\times(0,T).
\end{cases}
$$

To solve this problem numerically, we employ the expert interior-point optimization routine [IpOpt](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) combined with automatic differentiation and the modeling language [AMPL](https://ampl.com/). The interest of using **AMPL** together with **IpOpt** is that the gradient of the cost function and the constraints is automatically generated. Solving problems with **IpOpt** and AMPL can be made online through the [NEOS](https://neos-server.org/neos/) solvers.

To perform our simulations, we apply a FE method for the space discretization of the fractional Laplacian (see [1]) on a uniform space-grid

$$
x_i = -1 + \frac{2i}{N_x}, \quad i = 1,\ldots,N_x,
$$

with $N_x=20$ . Moreover, we use an explicit Euler scheme for the time integration on the time-grid

$$
t_j = \frac{Tj}{N_t}, \quad j = 0,\ldots,N_t,
$$

with $N_t$ satisfying the **Courant-Friedrich-Lewy** condition. In particular, we choose here $N_t=100$.

The AMPL code for solving this minimation problem is included below. In it, the matrices defining the dynamics are computed through specific functions implemented in **Matlab** and are given as parameters.

It is important to remark that we are interested in the controllability to the trajectory $\widehat{z}(\cdot,T)$ but, at the same time, $T$ is a variable in our code since it is the cost functional we aim to minimize. In view of that, our final target changes during the minimization process. Nevertheless this issue can be bypassed by taking advance of the linear nature of our equation and solving the *traslated* constrained minimization problem consisting in finding the minimial time for steering the inital datum $z_0-\widehat{z}_0$ by employing a control $u\geq\widehat{u}$ ($\widehat{z}_0$ and $\widehat{u}$ are the same given above).

end;
```

Once the minimization is concluded, we save the results in a file "data.txt" and we use **Matlab** to reshape the solution and the control so to obtain two $N_x\times(N_t+1)$ matrices for the plots.

This can be done through the following script:

```matlab
close all
% Read the data from the external file data.txt

fid= fopen('data.txt','r');
C = fscanf(fid,'%f',Inf);
T = C(1);
Nx = C(2);
Nt = C(3);
y = C(4:(Nt+1)*Nx+3);
u = C((Nt+1)*Nx+4:end);
fclose(fid);

% Reshape the state y and the control u into two Nx times Nt+1 matrices
y = reshape(y,Nx,Nt+1);
u = reshape(u,Nx,Nt+1);
```

From the reshaped solution and control, we can generate the plots. For instance, the m-file plot_control.m is the one generating **Figure 2** below.

The minimal time that we obtain from our minimization process is $T_{min}\simeq 0,2101$. Our simulations show that in this time horizon the fractional heat equation \ref{frac_heat} is controllable from the initial datum $z_0$ to the desired trajectory $\widehat{z}(\cdot,T)$ by maintaining the positivity of the solution (as it is expected since the initial datum is positive in $(-1,1)$, see **Figure 1**).

---------------------------
**Figure 1**. Controllability of the fractional heat equation \ref{frac_heat}in the minimal time $T_{min}=0.2101$.

Moreover, as it is observed also in **Figure 2**, the control has an impulsional behavior.

---------------------------
**Figure 2**. Minimal-time control. In the $(t,x)$ plane in blue the time $t$ varies from $t = 0$ (left) to $t = T_{min}$ (right).

This behavior of the control is not surprising. Indeed, as it was already observed in our previous works [3,4], the minimal-time controls are expected to be atomic measures, in particular linear combinations of Dirac deltas. Our simulations are thus consistent with the aforementioned papers.

The impulsional behavior of the control is then lost when extending the time horizon beyond $T_{min}$. This is shown in **Figure 3**, in which we display the behavior of the control steering the solution of the fractional heat equation \ref{frac_heat} from the initial datum $z_0$ to the target $\widehat{z}(\cdot,T)$ in the time horizon $T=0.4$.

![GitHub Logo]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/WP03/P0003/disposition_tlarge.png)
---------------------------
**Figure 3**. Behavior of the control in time $T = 0.4$. The white lines delimit the control region $\omega = (-0.3, 0.8)$. The regions in which the control is active are marked in yellow. The atomic nature is lost.

This control has been computed by employing once again **IpOpt** for solving the following minimization problem:

$$
\min\;\|z(\cdot,T)-\widehat{z}(\cdot,T)\|_{L^2(-1,1)}
$$

subject to

$$
\begin{cases}
z_t+(-d_x^2)^s z=u\chi_\omega, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)\times(0,T)
\\
z(x,0)=z_0\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)
\\
z(x,t)\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; (-1,1)\times(0,T)
\\
u(x,t)\geq 0, & a.\,e.\;in\; \omega\times(0,T).
\end{cases}
$$

As we can observe, the action of this control is now more distributed in $\omega$. Neverthelss, in accordance with our theoretical results, the equation is still controllable in the prescribed time horizon (see **Figure 4**)

![GitHub Logo]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/WP03/P0003/evolution_tlarge.gif)
---------------------------
**Figure 4**. Controllability of the fractional heat equation \ref{frac_heat}in time $T = 0.4$. The atomic behavior of the control is lost.

Finally, we consider the case of a time horizon $T<T_{min}$, in which constrained controllability is expected to fail. This time, we employ a classical conjugate gradient method implemented in the [DyCon Computational Toolbox]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/WP03/P0003/https://deustotech.github.io/dycon-toolbox-documentation/) for solving the above optimization problem.

As before, we apply a FE method for the space discretization of the fractional Laplacian on a uniform space-grid with $N_x=20$ points and we use an explicit Euler scheme for the time integration on a time-grid with $N_t=100$ points. Furthermore, we choose a time horizon $T=0.15$, which is below the minimal controllability time $T_{min}$.

Our simulation then show that the solution of \ref{frac_heat} fails to be controlled. In fact, **Figure 5** shows that the state computed by employing the tools of the [DyCon Computational Toolbox]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/imgs/WP03/P0003/https://deustotech.github.io/dycon-toolbox-documentation/) does not totally match the desired target in the time horizon prescribed.
