<h1>The problem</h1>

We consider the following one-dimensional Burgers equation 

$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq} 
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
\partial_t u(t,x)+\partial_x f(u(t,x))=0, \quad (t,x)\in \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}, \\
u(0,x)=u_0(x),
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
$$

where $u$ is the state, $u_0$ is the initial state and  the flux function $f$ is defined by $f(u)=\frac{u^2}{2}$. Kruzkov's theory  provides existence and uniqueness of a  solution  of \eqref{eq} with initial datum $u_0 \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb R)$. This solution is called a weak-entropy solution, denoted by $(t,x) \to S_t^+(u_0)(x)$. For a given target function $u^T$, we introduce the backward entropy  solution $(t,x) \to S^-_{t}(u^T)(x)$  as follows: 
for every $t\in [0,T]$, for a.e $x\in \mathbb R$, 

$$S^-_{t}(u^T)(x)= S^+_{t}(x\to u^T(-x))(-x).$$

We study the problem of inverse design for \eqref{eq}. This problem consists in  identifying the set of initial data evolving to a given target at a final time. 

Due to the time-irreversibility of the Burgers equation, some target functions are unattainable from weak-entropy solutions of this equation, making the inverse problem under consideration ill-posed. To get around this issue, we introduce the following  optimal control problem 

$$
\begin{equation} \tag{$\mathcal{O}_T$}\label{opt2} \inf_{u_0\in \mathcal{U}^0_{\text{ad}}} J_0(u_0):=\Vert u^T(\cdot)-S_T^+(u_0)(\cdot)\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb R)},\end{equation}
$$

where $u^T$ is a given target function and the class of admissible initial data $\mathcal{U}^0_{\text{ad}}$ in \eqref{opt2} is defined by 

$$
\begin{equation} \label{admissible_set}\mathcal{U}^0_{\text{ad}}=\{u_0\in BV(\mathbb R) \text{ such that } \Vert u_0 \Vert_{BV( \mathbb R)} < C \,  \text{and } \text{supp}(u_0)\subset K_0\}.\end{equation}
$$

Above, $$BV$$ stands for functions of bounded variation and  $C>0$ is a constant large enough. The study of \eqref{opt2} is motivated by the minimization of the sonic boom effects generated by supersonic aircrafts [2]. 

To solve the optimal control problem \eqref{opt2}, some difficulties arise from a  theoretical  and  numerical point of view. 
- Since the  entropy solution $u$ of \eqref{eq} may contain shocks even if the initial datum is a smooth function, this generates important added difficulties that have been the object of intensive study in the past, see  [3,4] and the references therein. In particular, the authors make sense of the derivative of $J_0$ in \eqref{opt2} in a weak way by requiring  strong conditions on the set of initial data. This leads to require that entropy solutions of \eqref{eq} have a finite number of non-interacting jumps.
- When $J_0$ is weakly differentiable,  gradient descent  methods have been implemented in [1,5,6] to solve numerically the optimal problem \eqref{opt2}. In the cases where it was applied successfully, only one possible initial datum emerges, namely the backward entropy solution $S_T^-(u^T)$. This is mainly due to the numerical viscosity that numerical schemes introduce to gain stability. To find some multiple minimizers, the authors in  [8]  use a filtering step in the backward adjoint solution.   

Dans [9], we fully characterize the set of minimizers of the optimal control problem \eqref{opt2}.

<b>Theorem 1.</b>  Let $u^T\in BV(\mathbb R)$. The optimal control problem \eqref{opt2}  admits multiple optimal solutions. Moreover, for a.e $T>0$, the initial datum $u_0\in BV(\mathbb R)$ is an optimal solution of \eqref{opt2} if and only if $u_0 \in BV(\mathbb R)$ verifies $S_T^+(u_0)=S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$.
 
A characterisation of the set $$\{u_0 \in BV(\mathbb R), S_T^+(u_0)=S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))\}$$ is given in [7]. An illustration of Theorem 1. is given in Figure 1.

The proof of Theorem 1 is structured as follows. From [7, Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.2] or [8, Corollary 1], there exists $u_0\in BV(\mathbb R)$ such that $$S^+_T(u_0)=q$$ if and only if $$q$$ satisfies  the one-sided Lipschitz condition, i.e 
$$ \begin{equation*}\partial_x q \leq \frac{1}{T}  \text{ in } \mathcal{D}'(\mathcal{R}).\end{equation*} $$
 Thus, the optimal problem \eqref{opt2} can be rewritten as  follows. 

 $$\begin{equation} \label{opt5} \min_{q\in \mathcal{U}^T_{\text{ad}}} J_1(q):=\Vert u^T-q \Vert_{L^2(\mathcal{R})},  \end{equation}$$

where the admissible set $\mathcal{U}^T_{\text{ad}}$ is defined by 

$$\begin{equation} \mathcal{U}^T_{\text{ad}}=\{ q\in BV(\mathbb R) \text{ such that } \, \, \partial_x q \leq \frac{1}{T} \,  \, \text{and } \Vert q \Vert_{BV( \mathbb R)} \leq C \, \text{and }\text{Supp}(q)\subset K_1 \}.\end{equation}$$

Above, $K_1$ an open bounded interval large enough.  Note that the optimal problem \eqref{opt5} is not related to the PDE model \eqref{eq}. We prove that $q=S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$ is a critical point of \eqref{opt5} using the first-order optimality conditions applied to \eqref{opt5} and the full characterization of the set $$ \{u_0 \in BV(\mathbb R) \text{ such that } S_T^-(u_0)=S_T^-(u^T)\}$$ given in [9, Theorem A.2].

<h1>Numerical simulations</h1>

In [9,Section 3], we  implement a wave-front tracking algorithm to construct numerically the set of  minimizers of \eqref{opt2}.  We consider for instance, a target function $$u^T$$  defined by

$$\begin{equation} \label{uT} u^T(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
2 &\text{if} \, \,x\in (-0.2,1.1)\bigcup(2,3.1)\bigcup (4.1,5.3)\bigcup (6.1,7.2), \\
-1 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}$$

From Theorem 1,  the backward solution $$S_T^-(u^T)$$ is an  optimal solution of \eqref{opt2} and  $$u_0$$ is an optimal solution of \eqref{opt2} if and only if  $$S_T^+(u_0)=S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$$. In Figure 2, the target function $$u^T$$, the backward solution $$S_T^-(u^T)$$ and  the backward-forward solution $$S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$$ are plotted.

Note that $$S_T^+(S_T^-(u^T))$$ has four different shocks located at $x=1.1$, $x=3.1$, $x=5.3$ and $x=7.2$. If we use a conservative numerical method as Godunov scheme,  the approximate solution of $$S_T^+(S_T^-(u^T))$$ doesn't have shocks because of numerical viscosity that numerical schemes introduced, see Video 1.

This implies that only one minimizer of \eqref{opt2} can be constructed using a Godunov scheme, which is the backward entropy solution $S_T^-(u^T)$. When a wave-front tracking algorithm is implemented, the approximate solution of $S_T^+(S_T^-(u^T))$ has shocks since we track the possible discontinuities from $u^T$ to  $S_T^+(S_T^-(u^T))$. This implies that all initial data $u_0$ that coincide with the approximate solution of $S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$ can be recovered, see [9,Section 3]. 

In Video 2, we show that the weak-entropy solution of \eqref{eq}  with initial data $S_T^-(u^T)$ coincides with $S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$ at time $T$.

In Video 3, three other approximate optimal solutions $u_0$ of \eqref{opt2} are constructed. In particular, we show that  $S_T^+ (u_0)=S_T^+ (S_T^-(u^T))$.
