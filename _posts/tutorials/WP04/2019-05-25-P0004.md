description: Autonomous Vehicles (briefly AVs) have already been tested on urban and highway networks and,  for the future they may be used to monitor and manage the   vehicular traffic. The impact of autonomous vehicles on vehicular traffic is modeled  by a PDE+ODE models with moving point-flux constraint. The PDE is a nonlinear  hyperbolic conservation laws and the ODE represents the trajectory of autonomous vehicles. We show that the data collected by autonomous vehicles' sensors can be used to reconstruct the traffic state.

### A coupled PDE-ODE model 
We consider the following hybrid PDE-ODE model  


$$ 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll} 
    \partial_t \rho(t,x) + \partial_x (f(\rho(t,x)))=0, & (t,x)\in R^+\times R, \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{(1a)} \\ 
    \rho(0,x)=\rho_{0}(x), & x\in R,\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \,\text{(1b)}\\
    \dot y_i(t)=v (\rho(t,y_i(t)+))), & t\in R^+, i=1,\cdots,M,\quad \,   \, \, \,\text{(1c)}\\
    y_i(0)=y_0^i, & i=1,\cdots,M.\quad \, \quad \quad \quad \quad \text{(1d)}\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$

Above, (1a) and (1b) consists  of  a  scalar  conservation proposed by Lighthill-Whitham-Richards law  modeling  the  evolution  of vehicular traffic. (1c) and (1d) represent the trajectory of autonomous vehicles. $$\rho$$ stands for the density of cars and  the flux function $$f$$ is defined by $$f(\rho)=\rho v(\rho)$$ with the average speed $$v(\rho)=1-\rho$$. 

We assume that $$\bar \rho_0$$ is an unknown function and our goal is to find a time $$T$$ at which it is possible to reconstruct the true density $$\rho$$ between two autonomous vehicles based only on the measured local density of each autonomous vehicle. 

We introduce the two following operators 
 * $$S_t(\rho_0)(x)$$ is the solution of (1a) at time $$t$$ and at the position $$x$$ with initial density $$\rho_0$$
 * $$\Gamma(\rho_0)=(\rho(\cdot,y_i(\cdot)\pm))_{i\in\{1,\cdots,M\}}$$ where $$(\rho,y_i)$$ is the solution of (1) with initial data $$\rho_0$$.

 | Figure 1.1 - $$\rho_0(x)=0.16$$ if $$x<1.33$$ and $$\rho_0(x)=0.63$$ if $$x>1.33$$ with two autonomous vehicles positioned at $$y_0^1=0$$ and $$y_0^2=3$$. | | | | |  | Figure 1.2 - $$\rho_1(x)=0.16$$ if $$x<1$$ and $$\rho_0(x)=0.47$$ if $$1<x<2$$ and $$\rho_0(x)=0.63$$ if $$2<2$$ with two connected vehicles positioned at $$y_0^1=0$$ and $$y_0^2=3$$  | 

In Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2, we construct two initial data $$\rho_0$$ and $$\rho_1$$ such that $$\Gamma(\rho_0)=\Gamma(\rho_1)$$ and for every $$t < 2$$ , for every $$x\in[y_1(t),y_2(t)]$$ , $$S_T(\rho_0)(x) \neq S_T(\rho_1))(x) $$. Thus, there isn't backward uniqueness from the trajectory of autonomous vehicles.

| Figure 1.3 $$\rho_0(x)=1$$ if $$x<10$$ and $$\rho_0(x)=0$$ if $$x>10$$ with two autonomous vehicles positioned at $x=8$ and $x=12$ respectively  | 



In Figure Figure 1.3, we cannot reconstruct the traffic state at any time using data collected by the two autonomous vehicles. Some additional conditions on the set of initial densities will be require.  



**Theorem** Let $$\bar \rho_0 \in BV(R,[0,1])\cap L^1(R)$$ and we assume that for every $$x\in R$$, $$0<\rho_{\min}\leq  \bar \rho_0(x) \leq \rho_{\max}$$.  For every $$i\in \{1,\cdots,M-1\}$$ there exists $$T_i>0$$ such that for every $$\rho_0 \in \Gamma^{-1}(\Gamma(\bar \rho_0))$$ and  for almost every $$x\in [y_i(T_i),y_{i+1}(T_i)]$$ we have 
$$S_{T_i}(\rho_0)(x)= S_{T_i}(\bar \rho_0)(x)$$

The reconstruction time $$T_i$$ is obtained using the notion of generalized characteristics and $$T_i$$ has an implicit form.

### Numerical simulations 
In  Figure 2.1 and  Figure 2.2, we consider the example of two shocks with a fan of rarefaction shocks between the two shocks. A total of three AVs, denoted  by $$AV_0$$ , $$AV_1$$ and $$AV_2$$ , are used to reconstruct the traffic state resulting in two regions of reconstruction between $$AV_0$$ and $$AV_1$$ , and between $$AV_1$$ and $$AV_2$$ . Specifically, the initial density $$\rho_0$$ is defined as follows : $\rho_0(x) = 0.0938 $ for $ x\in (-\infty, 8] $, $\rho_0(x) = 0.9062$ for $$x\in (8, 10]$$, $$\rho_0(x) = 0.2188$$ for $x\in (10, 13]$ and $\rho_0(x) = 0.9062$ for $$x\in (13, \infty)$$. $$AV_0$$ , $$AV_1$$ , and $$AV_2$$ start at $$x=5$$ , $$x=9$$ , and $$x=12$$ , respectively. The resulting traffic state solved using wave front tracking over the first 20 seconds is shown in Figure 2.1, while the reconstructed state between the AVs is shown in Figure 2.2. The time at which the reconstruction becomes valid is $$T_{0} = 6.87$$ between $$AV_0$$ and $$AV_1$$, and $$T_{1} = 3.39$$ between $$AV_1$$ and $$AV_2$$.

In  Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2, one autonomous vehicle, denoted by $$AV_0$$ , is deployed on a ring. The initial density $$\rho_0$$ is a $$10$$-periodic function  defined as follows:  $$\rho_0(x) = 0.8125 $$ for $$x\in (0,2)$$ , $$\rho_0(x) = 0.3125$$ for $$x\in (2, 10)$$ . Since $$\rho$$ and $$y_0$$ are also $$10$$ periodic functions, both trajectories plotted in red in  Figure 3.2  are  the ones of $$AV_0$$. The traffic state on the whole ring can be reconstructed after $$T_{\max}=15.444$$.
