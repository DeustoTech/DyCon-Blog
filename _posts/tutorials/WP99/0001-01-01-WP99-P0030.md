title: Controllability of a Class of Infinite Dimensional Systems with Age Structure
author: [DebayanM]
date: 2019-06-07
description: In this tutorial,  we investigate the linear infinite dimensional system obtained by implementing an age structure to a given  linear dynamical system. We show that if the initial system is null controllable in a time small enough, then the age structured system is also null controllable in a time depending on the various involved parameters.
