### Background and motivation


Let us consider the random heat equation described 
by the following system:

$$

\begin{cases}\tag{1}
y_t-\alpha \Delta y =f1_{G_0}, &\text{ in } (0,T)\times G,\\
y=0, & \text{ on } (0,T)\times \partial G,\\
y(0,\cdot)=y^0,  & \text{ on } G,
\end{cases}

$$

for $G$  a domain, $G_0\subset G$ a subdomain, 
$f$ a control,  $y^0$  the initial configuration 
and $\alpha$ the diffusivity coefficient, which is a positive 
random variable with density function $\rho$.
We have that the averaged solution of (1)
is given by:

$$
\tilde y(t,x;y^0,f):=\int_0^{+\infty} y(t,x;\alpha,y^0,f)\rho(\alpha)d\alpha.

$$

We want to determine if, given a positive random variable 
$\alpha$ and an initial configuration $y^0\in L^2(G)$, there 
is some $f\in L^2((0,T)\times G_0)$ such that $\tilde y(T,\cdot)=0$.


In order to illustrate the effect of averaging in
 the dynamics, let us study the dynamics of
(1) when $G=\mathbb R^d$ and $f=0$.
As averaging and the Fourier transform commute, we work on the
Fourier transform of the fundamental solution of the
heat equation, which is given by:

$$
\exp(-\alpha |\xi|^2t).
$$

Consequently, the Fourier transform of the average
of the fundamental solutions is given by:

$$

\int_0^{+\infty} \exp (-\alpha |\xi|^2t)\rho(\alpha)d\alpha;

$$


i.e. the Laplace transform of $\rho$ evaluated in $|\xi|^2t$. 
In particular, for $r\in(0,1)$ if $\rho(\alpha)\sim_{0^+} e^{-C\alpha^{-\frac{r}{1-r}}}$
we have that:


$$
\tag{2}
\int \exp (-\alpha |\xi|^2t)\rho(\alpha)d\alpha\sim \exp(-C|\xi|^{2r}t^r)

$$


when $|\xi|^2t\to+\infty$, which can be proved by the Laplace method.
Thus, for those density functions 
the averaged dynamics in $\mathbb R^d$ has a fractional nature. As it is proved in [1],
for $G$ bounded this is also true and we have the usual controllability 
and observability results of fractional dynamics;
that is, (2) implies that
the averaged unique continuation is preserved,
but (2) preserves the null averaged observability
if and only if $r>1/2$, being the threshold density functions  those
which satisfy: 

$$

\rho(\alpha)\sim_{0^+} e^{-C\alpha^{-1}}.

$$



### Some numerical simulations

Let us now illustrate the difference between several probability distributions for the diffusion through numerical simulations. For that, we recall that 
the optimal control is given by $\varphi(t,x;\phi)1_{G_0}$, for $\varphi$ the 
averaged solution of 

$$

\begin{cases}
-\varphi_t-\alpha \Delta \varphi=0, &\text{ in } (0,T)\times G,\\
\varphi=0, & \text{ on } (0,T)\times\partial G,\\
\varphi(T,\cdot)=\phi,  & \text{ on } G.
\end{cases}

$$

and $\phi$ the state which minimizes the functional: 
 
 $$

 J(\phi)= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T\int_{G_0}
\left|\int_0^{+\infty}\varphi(t,x;\alpha,\phi)\rho(\alpha)d\alpha\right|^2dxdt 
 \\+\left\langle  y^0, \int_0^{+\infty}\varphi(0;\alpha,\phi)\rho(\alpha)d\alpha\right\rangle.

$$

Due to the hardness of the numerical computations in higher dimensions and to get
better illustrations we work in $d=1$, and in particular in $G=(0,\pi)$.
We also consider $G_0=(1,2)$, $T=1$ and $y^0=\frac{1}{2}$. 
Moreover, to illustrate the difference between diffusivities inside and 
outside the null controllability regime, we consider $\rho=1\_{(1,2)}$, which is inside,
and $\rho=1\_{(0,1)}$, which is outside.


In order to numerically implement this problem, we approximate it by
minimizing $J$ in $V_M:=\langle e_i \rangle_{i=1}^M$ 
for $\{e_i\}$ the eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet Laplacian
 and for $M\in\{40,50,60\}$. 
Since $V_M$ is a finite dimensional space, computing the 
minimum of $J$ is equivalent to solving numerically a linear system,
which can be easily done by using any numerical computing environment
(in our case MATLAB). We have the following illustrations:


First, we illustrate in Figure 1 
(resp. in Figure 2)
the controls induced by the minimum of $J$ for $\rho=1\_{(1,2)}$
(resp. for $\rho=1\_{(0,1)}$).
For  $\rho=1\_{(1,2)}$ the 
sequence of controls converges, which is something that can be seen in an even 
more clear way when $t\in[0,1/2]$. Of course, the closer the time is to $1$,
the more slowly the punctual values of the control converges pointwise with $M$ 
(and in $t=1$ it diverges),
which is a well-known behaviour when
controlling a parabolic dynamics (see, for instance,
[2], [3] and [4]).
 However, for $\rho=1\_{(0,1)}$ the sequence of  controls 
diverges, which is something that we can appreciate in a more 
detailed way when $t\in[0,1/2]$.

Next, we show in Figure 3
the canonical prolongation of the previously obtained controls to $t=0$.
 Again, for $\rho=1\_{(1,2)}$  we have a clear convergence,
whereas for $\rho=1\_{(0,1)}$  it diverges.

we have considered $\rho =1_{(1,2)}$ and in the right one $\rho=1_{(0,1)}$.

Finally, we illustrate in Figure 4 the state at $t=1$
of the respective solutions of the averaged heat equation
 with the previously obtained controls.
For $\rho=1\_{(1,2)}$ the solution converges smoothly to $0$,
whereas for $\rho=1\_{(0,1)}$ the solution diverges.
