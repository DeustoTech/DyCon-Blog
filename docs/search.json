We then consider the same problem in a domain affected by a potential.",

We consider a device consisting of two conducting plates, connected to an electric circuit. The upper plate is rigid and fixed while the lower one is elastic and fixed only at the boundary. When a voltage (difference of potential between the two plates) is applied, the lower plate starts to bend and, if the voltage is large enough, the lower plate eventually touches the upper one. This is called touchdown phenomenon and our aim is to control the localization of touchdown points in the device by a suitable choice of the dielectric permittivity of the material.",
