	Abstract = {The Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model can be interpreted as a generalization of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, possessing a family of fundamental diagram curves, each of which represents a class of drivers with a different empty road velocity. A weakness of this approach is that different drivers possess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This drawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model, leading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model. We present an approach to determine the parameter functions of the GARZ model from fundamental diagram measurement data. The predictive accuracy of the resulting data-fitted GARZ model is compared to other traffic models by means of a three-detector test setup, employing two types of data: vehicle trajectory data, and sensor data. This work also considers the extension of the ARZ and the GARZ models to models with a relaxation term, and conducts an investigation of the optimal relaxation time.},

	Abstract = {For a given bounded connected domain in \$\$\{\{{\backslash}mathbbm\{R\}\}^n\}\$\$ R n , the issue of computing the observability constant associated with a wave operator, an observation time T and a generic observation subdomain constitutes in general a hard task, even for one-dimensional problems. In this work, we introduce and describe two methods to provide precise (and even sharp in some cases) estimates of observability constants for general one-dimensional wave equations: the first one uses a spectral decomposition of the solution of the wave equation, whereas the second one is based on a propagation argument along the characteristics. Both methods are extensively described and we then comment on the advantages and drawbacks of each one. The discussion is illustrated by several examples and numerical simulations. As a by-product, we deduce from the main results estimates of the cost of control (resp. the decay rate of the energy) for several controlled (resp. damped) wave equations.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we consider parabolic equations on a bounded open connected subset \$\$\{{\backslash}Omega\}\$\$ $\Omega$ of \$\$\{{\backslash}mathbb\{R\}^n\}\$\$ R n . We model and investigate the problem of optimal shape and location of the observation domain having a prescribed measure. This problem is motivated by the question of knowing how to shape and place sensors in some domain in order to maximize the quality of the observation: for instance, what is the optimal location and shape of a thermometer? We show that it is relevant to consider a spectral optimal design problem corresponding to an average of the classical observability inequality over random initial data, where the unknown ranges over the set of all possible measurable subsets of \$\$\{{\backslash}Omega\}\$\$ $\Omega$ of fixed measure. We prove that, under appropriate sufficient spectral assumptions, this optimal design problem has a unique solution, depending only on a finite number of modes, and that the optimal domain is semi-analytic and thus has a finite number of connected components. This result is in strong contrast with hyperbolic conservative equations (wave and Schr{\"o}dinger) studied in Privat et al. (J Eur Math Soc, 2015) for which relaxation does occur. We also provide examples of applications to anomalous diffusion or to the Stokes equations. In the case where the underlying operator is any positive (possible fractional) power of the negative of the Dirichlet-Laplacian, we show that, surprisingly enough, the complexity of the optimal domain may strongly depend on both the geometry of the domain and on the positive power. The results are illustrated with several numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {We consider the null-controllability problem for the Schr{\~A}¶dinger and heat equations with boundary control. We concentrate on short-time, or fast, controls. We improve recent estimates (see [L. Miller, Geometric bounds on the growth rate of null-controllability cost for the heat equation in small time, J. Differential Equations 204 (2004) 202{\^a}€``226; L. Miller, How violent are fast controls for Schr{\~A}¶dinger and plate vibrations?, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 172 (2004) 429{\^a}€``456; L.

Control Optim. 45 (2006) 762{\^a}€``772]) on the norm of the operator associating to any initial state the minimal norm control driving the system to zero. Our main results concern the Schr{\~A}¶dinger and heat equations in one space dimension. They yield new estimates concerning window problems for series of exponentials as described in [T.I.

	Abstract = {Abstract Let ( A , D ( A ) ) be a diagonalizable generator of a C 0 -semigroup of contractions on a complex Hilbert space X , B ∈ L ( C , Y ) , Y being some suitable extrapolation space of X , and u ∈ L 2 ( 0 , T ; C ) . Under some assumptions on the sequence of eigenvalues Λ = { λ k } k ≥ 1 ⊂ C of ( A , D ( A ) ) , we prove the existence of a minimal time T 0 ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ] depending on Bernstein's condensation index of Λ and on B such that y ′ = A y + B u is null-controllable at any time T &gt; T 0 and not null-controllable for T &lt; T 0 . As a consequence, we solve controllability problems of various systems of coupled parabolic equations. In particular, new results on the boundary controllability of one-dimensional parabolic systems are derived. These seem to be difficult to achieve using other classical tools. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Mobile sensing enabled by \{GPS\} or smart phones has become an increasingly important source of traffic data. For sufficient coverage of the traffic stream, it is important to maintain a reasonable penetration rate of probe vehicles. From the standpoint of capturing higher-order traffic quantities such as acceleration/deceleration, emission and fuel consumption rates, it is desirable to examine the impact on the estimation accuracy of sampling frequency on vehicle position. Of the two issues raised above, the latter is rarely studied in the literature. This paper addresses the impact of both sampling frequency and penetration rate on mobile sensing of highway traffic. To capture inhomogeneous driving conditions and deviation of traffic from the equilibrium state, we employ the second-order phase transition model (PTM). Several data fusion schemes that incorporate vehicle trajectory data into the \{PTM\} are proposed. And, a case study of the \{NGSIM\} dataset is presented which shows the estimation results of various Eulerian and Lagrangian traffic quantities. The findings show that while first-order traffic quantities can be accurately estimated even with a low sampling frequency, higher-order traffic quantities, such as acceleration, deviation, and emission rate, tend to be misinterpreted due to insufficiently sampled vehicle locations. We also show that a correction factor approach has the potential to reduce the sensing error arising from low sampling frequency and penetration rate, making the estimation of higher-order quantities more robust against insufficient data coverage of the highway traffic. },
