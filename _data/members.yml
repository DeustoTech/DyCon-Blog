Before that, she earned her PhD in Numerical Analysis at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, <a href="http://www.maths.lu.se/english/" target="_blank">Lund University</a> (Sweden) under the supervision of Prof. Philipp Birken. Her thesis was focused on the numerical aspects around the partitioned approach for the simulation of time-dependent thermal fluid-structure interaction. Earlier, she was awarded an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to participate in the <a href="http://www.mathmods.eu/" target="_blank">MSc programme MATHMODS</a> (Mathematical Modelling in Engineering - Theory, Numerics, Applications). Her main research interests are domain decomposition methods, coupled problems, PDEs and time adaptive multirate time integration methods.</p><ul class="list-nomarker"><li><i class="fa fa-envelope fa-blue"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:azahar.monge@deusto.es">azahar.monge@deusto.es</a></li><li><i class="fa fa-phone fa-blue"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="tel:34944139003,3282">(+34) 944 139 003 Ext. 3282</a></li></ul>

He earned his PhD in observation and control for some conservative systems under the supervision of Alain Haraux and Yannick Privat. His previous Postdoctoral positions were focused on the study of strongly coupled PDE/ODE systems where the PDE consists of a system of conservation laws and the ODE represents the trajectory of particles. Therefore, his main research interests are control theory, calculus of variations, hybrid PDE/ODE, scalar conservation laws with constraints and Wave-front tracking methods.</p>
