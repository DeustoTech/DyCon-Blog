UmbertoB:
  name: Umberto Biccari
  description: Umberto Biccari is a PhD. Currently he holds a Postdoctoral position at the ERC Advanced Grant project DyCon under the supervision of Prof. Enrique Zuazua (UAM and DeustoTech). In the past, he collaborated within the ERC research project NUMERIWAVES. His current research interests are related to the analysis of Partial Differential Equations, in particular from the point of view of control theory. During the years of his PhD he has been concerned with the study of controllability properties of hyperbolic (waves), parabolic (heat) and dispersive (Schrödinger) PDEs, involving non-local terms, singular inverse-square potentials, variable degenerate coefficients or dynamical boundary conditions. At the moment, he is getting interested in non-local transport problems, derived from models of collection behaviour.
JesusO:
  name: Jesus Oroya
  description: Jesus Oroya is the Software Expert in DyCon Dynamic Control, the Advanced Research Project funded by the European Research Council(ERC). He got a BSc in Physics from the University of the Basque Country, specializing in physical simulation. He has worked at CIC Nanogune for the company SIMUNE, looking for a method of optimization of atomic bases for calculations of electronic structure in the SIESTA code. In 2017, he worked at Accenture, managing and analyzing databases. He has also developed business applications for Liberty Seguros. Currently he is studying a MSc in Computational Engineering and Intelligent Systems in the University of the Basque Country.

AnaN:
  name: Ana Navarro
  description: Ana Navarro is a PhD. Currently she holds a Postdoctoral position at the ERC Advanced Grant project DyCon under the supervision of Prof. Enrique Zuazua (UAM and DeustoTech). Before that, she had a Predoctoral position at the Instituto Universitario de Matemática Multidisciplinar financed by the Universitat Politècnica de València. Her main research interest is the study from a probabilistic point of view of different problems based on differential equations (ordinary or partial) with uncertainty in its formulation. Now, she is concerned to connect her recent research with Control Theory.
