  name: Control of parameter dependent problems
  wp: WP1
  acr: PDC
  description: <p>We aim to adapt the existing techniques of reduced modelling and nonlinear approximation by exploiting the notion of sparsity, in order to build optimal methods (with respect to the computational cost and complexity) for controlling parameter-dependent PDEs in a robust manner. To this end, we rely on the use of greedy and weak-greedy algorithms to identify the most meaningful realizations of the parameters and ${L^1}$ minimisation to search for impulsional controls.</p>
              <p>For doing this we view the parameter-dependent family of controls and controlled solutions as a manifold in the product control/state space.</p>
              <p>These techniques are applied and tested in some classical benchmark control problems for parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, but can also be adapted to more challenging problems as the optimal location of controllers and actuators.</p>
WP02:
  name: Long time horizon control
  wp: WP2
  acr: LTHC
  description: <p>We aim at developing a systematic turnpike theory for evolution PDEs. Our preliminary results show that this not only depends on the model under consideration but also on the cost functional and control target, and that the fulfillment of the turnpike property requires the system under consideration to be controllable or stabilisable. </p>
              <p>The theory developed so far allows to handle, mostly, linear PDEs, but the problem is widely open in the <strong>nonlinear</strong> frame, where the existing results require smallness conditions on the objectives (probably of a purely technical nature), which restrict the scope of applications. </p>
WP03:
  name: Control under constraints
  wp: WP3
  acr: CC
  description: <p>Most of the existing theory of controllability for PDEs has been developed in the absence of <strong>constraints on the controls and states</strong>. Thus, in practice, available results do not guarantee that controlled trajectories fulfil the physical constraints of the processes under consideration. Nevertheless, these constraints, often formulated as unilateral bounds on the control and/or controlled state, play a fundamental role in many applications. This is particularly the case in the context of <strong>diffusion processes</strong> (heat conduction, mathematical biology and population dynamics, etc.) which enjoy the property of <strong>positivity preserving</strong> of the free dynamics, in the absence of control.</p>
              <p>Recent results by our team allow proving, in a number of relevant situations, including linear and semilinear heat equations, that systems can be controlled under positivity constraints on the control when the control time is long enough. Furthermore, there is a minimal time for this property to hold. In other words, constrained controllability can't be achieved if the time horizon is too short.</p>
              <p>Our numerical experiments also show that, often, minimal time controls develop a sparsity pattern that is not yet fully understood. </p>
WP04:
  name: Inverse design of time-irreversible models
  wp: WP4
  acr: SINV
  description: <p>We aim at developing a theory allowing the inverse design in the absence of <strong>backward uniqueness</strong> to be addressed both for linear and nonlinear problems. We shall take advantage of the fact that initial data recovered by backward <strong>weak but not entropic solutions</strong> can lead to the desired target by the forward entropic flow. This leads to the interesting and non-standard question of building numerical schemes to approximate non-entropic weak solutions. This program will also be developed in the context of <strong>Hamilton-Jacobi</strong> equations where, among the wide class of weak solutions, the physical ones are characterized by the viscosity criterion.</p>
WP05:
  name: Models involving memory terms and hybrid PDE+ODE systems
  wp: WP5
  acr: MHM
  description: <p>Our recent contributions in this area are inspired in the interpretation of memory models as the <strong>coupling of PDEs with infinite-dimensional ODEs</strong>. The presence of ODE components in the system explains the failure of controllability if the control is confined on a space-support which is time-independent. This motivates the use of our <strong>moving control strategy</strong>, making the control move covering the whole domain, introducing the transport effects that the ODE is lacking.</p>
WP06:
  name: Finite versus infinite-dimensional dynamical systems
  wp: WP6
  acr: FI
  description: <p>Our team has made several contributions in the description of the limit behaviour, as the mesh sizes tend to zero, of <strong>numerical schemes for wave and Schrödinger equations</strong> from a control theoretical perspective. These results show that, in particular, filtering the high frequency numerical spurious solutions is necessary (and a good remedy) to assure the convergence of numerical schemes from a control perspective. These results also provide insight into the link between <strong>conservative finite</strong> and <strong>infinite-dimensional dynamical systems</strong> and their asymptotic behaviour.</p>

  name: Dynamic Programming and Feedback Optimal Control
  acr: FOPC
  description: In this area, the control problem is considered, where state dependent control is sought. This approach allows us to obtain the solution of the control problem for any initial condition. Here we will study the principle of dynamic programming, the Bellman Hamilton Jacobi equation, the Reinforcement Learning methodology.
