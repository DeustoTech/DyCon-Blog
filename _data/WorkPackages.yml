  name: Control of parameter dependent problems
  description: <p>In real applications, models are not completely known since relevant parameters (deterministic or stochastic) are subject to uncertainty and indetermination. Accordingly, for practical purposes, robust analytical and computational methods are needed, allowing to control not only a given realization of the model but also to deal with parameter-dependent families of systems in a stable, robust and computationally efficient way. This issue requires the development of specific new analytical and numerical tools and constitutes one of our major objectives. We mainly focus on the deterministic setting, although our techniques can also be adapted to stochastic and random models.</p>
              <p>Averaged control is a first important concept that aims to control the averaged dynamics. This is often a challenging issue since the model governing the evolution of the averaged dynamics is usually hard to be determined and may change type with respect to the original parameter-depending dynamics. Furthermore, in some practical applications, averaged control turns out to be insufficient since it does not guarantee to control the variance of the states. New techniques are needed to guarantee the efficient control of the system for all the realizations of the parameter values.</p>
              <p>We aim to adapt the existing techniques of reduced modelling and nonlinear approximation by exploiting the notion of sparsity, in order to build optimal methods (with respect to the computational cost and complexity) for controlling parameter-dependent PDEs in a robust manner. To this end, we rely on the use of greedy and weak-greedy algorithms to identify the most meaningful realizations of the parameters and L^1 minimisation to search for impulsional controls.</p>
              <p>For doing this we view the parameter-dependent family of controls and controlled solutions as a manifold in the product control/state space.</p>
              <p>These techniques are applied and tested in some classical benchmark control problems for parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs, but can also be adapted to more challenging problems as the optimal location of controllers and actuators.</p>
WP02:
  name: Long time horizon control
  description: <p>Control problems for evolution PDEs are most often considered in <strong>finite time intervals</strong>, without paying attention to the length of the control horizon and how it affects the nature of optimal trajectories and controls. However, the effective available time horizon is one of the critical factors in applications, as it occurs in the design of medical therapies, or in sonic boom minimisation for supersonic aircrafts. Some hyperbolic models fail to be controllable when the time horizon is too short but, even for parabolic models for which control can be achieved in any time horizon, the nature of optimal controls and trajectories depend very sensibly in the length of the control time.</p>
              <p>Often, for practical applications, and in order to simplify the complexity of the problem under consideration, it is assumed that, if the uncontrolled free dynamics tends to a steady configuration as time tend to infinity, optimal dynamic control strategies will do the same, converging to the optimal steady state ones when the time horizon for control tends to infinity. This is the so-called <strong>turnpike property</strong> that guarantees that, for long time horizons of control, controls and controlled trajectories are exponentially close to the steady-state ones except near the initial and final times. However, this property is rarely proved rigorously.</p>
              <p>We aim at developing a systematic turnpike theory for evolution PDEs. Our preliminary results show that this not only depends on the model under consideration but also on the cost functional and control target, and that the fulfillment of the turnpike property requires the system under consideration to be controllable or stabilisable. </p>
              <p>The theory developed so far allows to handle, mostly, linear PDEs, but the problem is widely open in the <strong>nonlinear</strong> frame, where the existing results require smallness conditions on the objectives (probably of a purely technical nature), which restrict the scope of applications. </p>
              <p>Turnpike theory has also important consequences for the development of <strong>efficient numerical solvers and software</strong>. Indeed, in practice, when the control problem is formulated in long time intervals, standard iterative algorithms based on adjoint methodologies are computationally expensive, relying on the recurrent resolution of the forward state dynamics and the backward adjoint one. The use of the turnpike property, starting from the optimal steady control and state, contributes to achieving faster approximation procedures in long time horizons.</p>
              <p><strong>Optimal shape and coefficient design</strong> problems constitute also a challenging field in which turnpike theory would be worth to be developed.</p>
WP03:
  name: Control under constraints
  description: <p>Most of the existing theory of controllability for PDEs has been developed in the absence of <strong>constraints on the controls and states</strong>. Thus, in practice, available results do not guarantee that controlled trajectories fulfil the physical constraints of the processes under consideration. Nevertheless, these constraints, often formulated as unilateral bounds on the control and/or controlled state, play a fundamental role in many applications. This is particularly the case in the context of <strong>diffusion processes</strong> (heat conduction, mathematical biology and population dynamics, etc.) which enjoy the property of <strong>positivity preserving</strong> of the free dynamics, in the absence of control.</p>
              <p>The heat equation is one of the most paradigmatic examples. Solutions remain non-negative when the initial data and applied forces are non-negative. But, can the trajectory, under the action of the control, be kept non-negative when the initial datum and final target are non-negative? </p>
              <p>By now it is well known that optimal L^2-controls fail to fulfil this property since they develop significant oscillations that are enhanced when the time horizon of control is small. This is due to the <strong>ill-posedness of the backward parabolic dynamics</strong> and eventually leads to controlled trajectories that go beyond the physical thresholds.</p>
              <p>Similar issues also arise in many relevant applications to <strong>contact and multi-body dynamics in biomechanics</strong>, modelled through differential inequalities, constraints and free boundary problems, poorly understood from a control theoretical viewpoint. </p>
              <p>The topic is also relevant when validating linear PDE models, often obtained through <strong>asymptotic limit processes</strong> under suitable smallness conditions on solutions. Whether controlled trajectories preserve those smallness requirements is often an open problem.</p>
              <p>Recent results by our team allow proving, in a number of relevant situations, including linear and semilinear heat equations, that systems can be controlled under positivity constraints on the control when the control time is long enough. Furthermore, there is a minimal time for this property to hold. In other words, constrained controllability can't be achieved if the time horizon is too short.</p>
              <p>Our numerical experiments also show that, often, minimal time controls develop a sparsity pattern that is not yet fully understood. </p>
WP04:
  name: Inverse design of time-irreversible models
  description: <p>Some important PDE models in Continuum Physics, such as <strong>hyperbolic conservation laws</strong>, represent a major challenge from a control viewpoint for the following (closely related) reasons.
              <ol>
              <li><strong>solutions lack regularity properties</strong> and develop shock discontinuities in finite time, making linearization methods inapplicable</li>
              <li>the property of <strong>backward uniqueness</strong> is lost in the absence of viscosity effects and the most elementary control problem (but relevant in applications), that of <strong>inverse design</strong>, aimed at identifying the initial source leading to the available measurements at the final time, is severely <strong>ill-posed</strong>.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Similar issues arise in the context of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.</p>
              <p>The existing methods, both the classical ones based on adjoint methodology or the more recent ones relying on sparsity and l1-minimization, provide numerical approximations of one of the possible initial sources. But these tools are not yet capable to provide all the feasible realizations for strongly time-irreversible systems as hyperbolic conservation laws. This issue is one of our main objectives, because of its implications in a number of key areas, such as management of natural resources.</p>
              <p>We aim at developing a theory allowing the inverse design in the absence of <strong>backward uniqueness</strong> to be addressed both for linear and nonlinear problems. We shall take advantage of the fact that initial data recovered by backward <strong>weak but not entropic solutions</strong> can lead to the desired target by the forward entropic flow. This leads to the interesting and non-standard question of building numerical schemes to approximate non-entropic weak solutions. This program will also be developed in the context of <strong>Hamilton-Jacobi</strong> equations where, among the wide class of weak solutions, the physical ones are characterized by the viscosity criterion.</p>

  name: Models involving memory terms and hybrid PDE+ODE systems
  description: <p>Control theory for PDEs has been quite exhaustively developed for model problems (heat and wave equations). But other important models in applications, of hybrid nature, remain poorly understood. This is particularly the case for models involving <strong>memory terms in viscoelasticity</strong>.</p>
              <p>Our recent contributions in this area are inspired in the interpretation of memory models as the <strong>coupling of PDEs with infinite-dimensional ODEs</strong>. The presence of ODE components in the system explains the failure of controllability if the control is confined on a space-support which is time-independent. This motivates the use of our <strong>moving control strategy</strong>, making the control move covering the whole domain, introducing the transport effects that the ODE is lacking.</p>
              <p>This theory applies to some model examples and an in-depth effort is needed to cope with key issues such as nonlinearity, general relaxation kernels, memory terms in the principal part of the PDE, etc. which are particularly complex for wave models, because of the lack of regularizing effects.</p>
              <p>Based on our past experience in developing numerical solvers, the numerical counterparts for the control of models with memory terms will also be developed.</p>
              <p>This topic also opens up the perspective of applications to other areas where ODE-PDE models arise, such as population dynamics.</p>
WP06:
  name: Finite versus infinite-dimensional dynamical systems
  description: <p>Our team has made several contributions in the description of the limit behaviour, as the mesh sizes tend to zero, of <strong>numerical schemes for wave and Schrödinger equations</strong> from a control theoretical perspective. These results show that, in particular, filtering the high frequency numerical spurious solutions is necessary (and a good remedy) to assure the convergence of numerical schemes from a control perspective. These results also provide insight into the link between <strong>conservative finite</strong> and <strong>infinite-dimensional dynamical systems</strong> and their asymptotic behaviour.</p>
              <p>However, the interplay between finite and infinite-dimensional dynamics in control arises in other contexts as well, such as in applications to <strong>collective dynamics</strong> and <strong>pedestrian flow</strong> or <strong>in material sciences</strong>. The corresponding effective mean-field models are often described by continuous PDEs involving non-local (in space) terms, modelling interactions between agents, and this adds significant novelties to the qualitative behaviour of these systems and raises new interesting problems from a control theoretical perspective.</p>
              <p>One of our main is further developing the needed control theory to link finite to infinite-dimensional dynamics, with these applications in mind. This requires a significant effort to cope with the non-linear and non-local effects and the fact that the control often appears in a bilinear manner and not as a right-hand side source term.</p>
              <p>Special attention will also be devoted to developing numerical schemes preserving the asymptotic properties of the PDE. This issue was addressed for the <strong>Kolmogorov equation</strong>, providing numerical schemes preserving <strong>hypocoercivity</strong> and <strong>hypoellipticity</strong> properties of the continuous PDE.</p>
